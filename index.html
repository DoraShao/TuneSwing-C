<p> TuneSwing is an iOS application that allows users to listen to music based on their mood and color preference. The app will feature an interactive slider that has a different intensity of music for wherever the icon is placed. By doing so, the users will be able to get a taste for a variety of music by simply choosing a different color on the slider. The app will also feature a recommendation page, which will allow the various playlists to grow and become more individualized. By keeping a simple user interface while ensuring a perfect soundtrack for any activity, we hope to reinvent the world of music sharing in all spectrums.</p>

<p> Simply use the interactive slider to pick a color and let your experience begin, just make sure you have a stable wifi connection. We also allow for recommendations which allows the music library to grow and become more universal. All you have to do is provide us with the song and where it belongs, we'll do the rest.</p>
